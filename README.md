### The purpose
This application is intended for a large variety of audience. Anyone that has access to the application can enter the app and place an order for an item that is for sale in the store. The application is geared towards businesses that want to sell a variety of products on the internet. This app is made for businesses to be able to publish their products in order to reach a larger audience and generate more sales as well.

### Instructions
Upon entering the application, the user can choose to make a purchase or exit the program. If the user chooses to make a purchase, then the items that are available will populate onto the screen, at this time the user can make a selection on which item they would like and how many of those items they would like. Once everything is chosen, then the user will see a summary of their purchase along with a total for their order.

### Technologies
In bamazon, I used multiple technologies in order to achieve success in creating this app.
*   MySQL
*   Node.js
    ###### Dependencies
    *   Inquirer NPM PAckage
    *   MYSQL NPM Package

## Organization
This program contains all of its code and is ran from one single Javascript file. Along with the single Javacript file, the program gets its information from the MYSQL database that contains all of the items available for sale in the app.
